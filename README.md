## 1: Evolutionary Algorithms	
Traveling Salesman Problem
## 2: Supervised Learning		
This exercise is to get a better understanding of supervised learning with gradient descent. 
In particular, consider the similarities and differences between linear classifiers and multi-layer feed forward networks (multi-layer perceptron, MLP) and the differences and similarities between binary and multi-class classification. 
A main part is dedicated to implementing and understanding the backpropagation algorithm.
## 3: Unsupervised Learning		
This exercise has three parts. The first part is focused on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Implent PCA from scratch to do compression and visualization of data.
The second part focuses on clustering using K-means. I used scikit-learn to run K-means clustering, and use PCA to visualize the results.
The last part ties supervised and unsupervised learning together in an effort to evaluate the output of K-means using a logistic regression for multi-class classification approach.
