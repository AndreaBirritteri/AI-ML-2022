    "## Rules\n",
    "Before you begin the exercise, review the rules at this website:\n",
    "https://www.uio.no/english/studies/examinations/compulsory-activities/mn-ifi-mandatory.html\n",
    "(This is an individual assignment. You are not allowed to deliver together or copy/share source-code/answers\n",
    "with others.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Especially, notice that you are **not allowed to use code or parts of code written by others** in your submission. We do check your code against online repositories, so please be sure to **write all the code yourself**. Read also the \"Routines for handling suspicion of cheating and attempted cheating at the University of Oslo\": https://www.uio.no/english/studies/examinations/cheating/index.html By submitting this assignment, you confirm that you are familiar with the rules and the consequences of breaking them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "**Deadline**: Friday, February 25 2022, 23:59\n",
    "\n",
    "Your submission should be delivered in Devilry. You may redeliver in Devilry before the deadline, but include all files in the last delivery, as only the last delivery will be read. You are recommended to upload preliminary versions hours (or days) before the final deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to deliver?\n",
    "\n",
    "You are recommended to solve the exercise in a Jupyter notebook, but you might solve it in a Python program if you prefer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you choose Jupyter, you should deliver the notebook. You should answer all questions and explain what you are doing in Markdown. Still, the code should be properly commented. The notebook should contain results of your runs. In addition, you should make a pdf of your solution which shows the results of the runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you prefer not to use notebooks, you should deliver the code, your run results, and a pdf-report where you answer all the questions and explain your work.\n",

    "\n",
    "Deliver one single zipped folder (.zip, .tgz or .tar.gz) which contains your complete solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Important: if you weren’t able to finish the assignment, use the PDF report/Markdown to elaborate on what you’ve tried and what problems you encountered. Students who have made an effort and attempted all parts of the assignment will get a second chance even if they fail initially. This exercise will be graded PASS/FAIL."
